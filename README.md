# Hermes-2.0
This is version 2 of Hermes. The Hermes system uses a multi platform desktop application, an Android application along with a database server, internet connection and a router to help manage the store remotely.

Identifying store items with a barcode scanner, completing retail transactions and generating bills are the three main tasks performed by the system. The system can be configured to either run as a centralized system or as a distributed system.
